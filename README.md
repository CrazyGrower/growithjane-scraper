# GrowLog Scraper 🌱

A simple tool to extract your grow logs from GrowWithJane and generate a detailed PDF report.

## 🚀 Features

- Automatic extraction of your GrowWithJane journal
- Clean PDF generation with your photos and actions
- Progress tracking (germination, growth, etc.)
- Headless mode support (no GUI)
- Complete history of watering and nutrients
- Automatic date and duration formatting

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before installing the script, make sure you have:

- Python 3.x installed
- Google Chrome installed
- ChromeDriver compatible with your Chrome version ([download here](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/))
- Internet access

## 💾 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/growithjane-scraper.git
cd growithjane-scraper
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
```bash
# On Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Configuration**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and configure your variables:
```plaintext
# Your GrowWithJane grow log URL
GROWLOG_URL=https://growithjane.com/growlog/growlog-example/

# Path to your ChromeDriver
CHROMEDRIVER_PATH=/path/to/chromedriver
```

**Important note:** 
- Replace `growlog-example` in the URL with your grow log identifier
- Replace `/path/to/chromedriver` with the actual path to your ChromeDriver:
  - On macOS (with Homebrew): typically `/opt/homebrew/bin/chromedriver`
  - On Linux: use `which chromedriver` to find the path
  - On Windows: use `where chromedriver` then copy the full path

## 🎯 Usage

### Simple Mode
```bash
python main.py
```

### Verbose Mode (more details)
```bash
python main.py -v
```

The PDF will be generated in the current folder with your grow log name.

## 📸 Output Example

The generated PDF includes:
- A title page with your grow name
- A progress status (In Progress/Completed)
- Journal entries with:
  - Date and grow day
  - Plant state
  - Actions (watering, nutrients, etc.)
  - Progress photos

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Error: "chromedriver" not found
```
selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: 'chromedriver' executable needs to be in PATH
```
**Solution:** 
1. Find your ChromeDriver path:
   ```bash
   which chromedriver  # On Linux/macOS
   where chromedriver  # On Windows
   ```
2. Copy the full path to your `.env` file:
   ```plaintext
   CHROMEDRIVER_PATH=/exact/path/to/chromedriver
   ```

### Error: "No module named 'selenium'"
**Solution:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Error: "Invalid URL"
**Solution:**
Check that the URL in your `.env` file is correct and accessible. It should look like:
```plaintext
GROWLOG_URL=https://growithjane.com/growlog/your-unique-identifier/
```
